The Blessed Nicholas Catholic Heritage Association is a private association of the Catholic faithful, who want to practice and share the fullness of the Catholic Faith in Thailand.

Members pray together, attend Holy Mass, study the catechism, promote all forms of Catholic heritage.  Whether inviting priests to celebrate the Tridentine Mass, forming a Gregorian chant schola, or teaching others about the Faith, every Catholic in Thailand can join the Catholic Heritage Association.
