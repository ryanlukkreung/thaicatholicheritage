Last night, the Blessed Nicholas Catholic Heritage Association (Thailand) organized a Latin rosary at the Paroisse Francophone de Bangkok (MEP Silom) at 19h30.

The rosary was prayed for the intentions, health, and salvation of our archbishop, Francis Xavier Kriengsak Cardinal Kovithavanij.

While attendance was light at the beginning, a total of 22 people came last night for the rosary, other prayers, and even some fellowship outside of the church afterwards. It was wonderful to see people from many parts of the world: Thailand, the Philippines, Pakistan, France, and beyond.

Thank you to all who came to pray with us. We look forward to seeing you all again soon.
